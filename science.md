GPT-Neo 1.3B may be "too smart for its own good" here. Some exemplary failures:
> FAIL: 'What is 61 ^ 65?' => ' It's a number greater than 0.'
> 
> FAIL: 'What is 95 - 19?' => ' It is a mathematical formula.'
> 
> FAIL: 'What is 46 ^ 69?' => ' I'm guessing it's an integer, but I'm not sure.'
> 
> FAIL: 'What is 76 ^ 2?' => ' I think I'm a robot.'
